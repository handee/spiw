# Schools Plant Imaging Workshop

These files accompany a schools plant imaging workshop, created by Hannah Dee and colleagues as part of EPSRC Grant EP/LO17253/1.

The aim of the workshops is to introduce school-aged pupils to the concepts of
plant imaging, and to image processing by building up a set of python programs
that can open and investigate properties of images.  The images in question are
images of plants as they grow. 

The files in this repository are the Python programs which will be built up
over time by participants. 

The aim is for participants to carry out each workshop in turn, however it is
possible to skip workshop one and use images of plants that have been recorded
in advance. A link to various sets of images to use in these workshops will be
added to this page shortly.

1. [Image capture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXNXWhs49XUKWZl5s51mYF4Rpl44P00eih7Ulr8CHvw/edit?usp=drive_web) covers the acquisition of a set of timelapse images using a Raspberry Pi camera over a series of weeks.

2. [Colour space and light changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cAqEZQ-llwgvifhOiNROsFp91AaMjjU0qJOn5F7wb5o/edit) covers the opening of files, investigating the value at a particular pixel location, plotting a graph of pixel values, and converting between BGR and HSV colour spaces.
